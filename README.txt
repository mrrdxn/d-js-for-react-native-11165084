//arrayManipulation and userInfo run on serverside rather than client side

---------------------------------------------------------------

*arrayManipulation
    the function arrayProcess takes user inputs and stores it in userInputs[].
    the function takes the values of the array and multiplies it by itself(squares it) if it is even but multiplies it by three if it is odd

    the function formatArrayStrings takes an array of strings and stores it in userStrings[].
    the function takes the values of the array and converts it to uppercase if the value of userInputs is even but converts it to lowercase if the value is odd.

---------------------------------------------------------------

*userInfo
    arrayManipulation is imported into this file
    arrayProcess is implemented in the userInfo file.
    formatArrayStrings is overriden in createUserProffiles but generally has the same functionality. an additional segment of code was added to return pairs of original input of user and its modified form along with their index starting from index 1
